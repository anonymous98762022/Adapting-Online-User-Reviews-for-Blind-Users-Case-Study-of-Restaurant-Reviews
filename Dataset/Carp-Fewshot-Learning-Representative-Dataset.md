| La Bernadin is easily the greatest culinary disappointment in the city given its 3 star rating. The ambience, stuffy and drab. While the service is attentive, the food is absolutely lacking and overpriced. It’s baffling to me this continues to retain 3 stars. The dishes are common fair that you’re familiar with, nothing unique or creative here: shrimp, salmon, halibut, snapper, lobster, and so on. For $325 the tasting brings you 8 courses, 2 of which are dessert bites. The fish, dainty and unremarkable leaves you wishing you had just stopped for a slice or spent your money at literally any other venture in the city. $1300 for a group of 3 with one wine pairing, our table agreed the morsels were middling at best, the 1 bite of salmon and caviar is easily the star of the show. The dessert, it’s hard to go wrong with sorbet and chocolate so enjoy your one bite of each. And to end the journey a chefs compliment of dessert containing nuts for my nut allergic friend, good thing he was paying attention otherwise we would have had a medical emergency on our hands. Was anything comped for risking his life? No, a simple “oops sorry” was provided. It’s truly amazing to me this institution, likely a shell of its former self, where the faux luxury is as thin as the foam on your appetizer, continues to be regarded with any esteem whatsoever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative']]                                                    |
| We came to this 3-star Michelin restaurant with high hopes, but unfortunately, it fell far short of our expectations. We opted for the seafood chef's tasting menu last night, and it was a letdown from start to finish. Out of eight courses, five featured fish, and every dish seemed almost identical in preparation and flavor – overwhelmingly salty, monotonous, and presented in the same uninspired manner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [['Food', 'Negative']]                                                                                                               |
| I typically don't leave reviews, but I spent a ton on the vegetarian tasting menu with two cocktails, and it was one of the worst meals I've ever had at a Michelin starred restaurant. Aside from the amuse-bouche and the palate cleanser, each of the courses was undercooked, overcooked, or flavorless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Hygiene', 'Negative']]                                                                                      |
| Visiting this three-star Michelin-rated establishment led to a disheartening experience. The presence of plastic in one of the dishes was not just alarming but also starkly contrasted with the high standards expected from such a reputed venue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Hygiene', 'Negative']]                                                                                      |
| Extremely disappointed with the service. Explicitly mentioned my boyfriend had a tree nuts allergy from the start. Everything was going well until the very end when we were served four different desserts. The server didn’t even bother to explain what kind of dessert each of them were.

| I recently had an unfortunate experience dining at Le Bernardin, and I must say that it was a complete disappointment. The restaurant's Michelin star should be revoked based on the numerous issues I encountered throughout my meal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [['Food', 'Negative']]                                                                                                               |

| The food was more enjoyable than the service. We are from France too and this was a laughable experience for us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                             |
| An honest 5 Star place between food and service. I usually never write reviews but after taking my wife out for a quick dinner I was very impressed. 1.) The food was made fresh in front of me and fairly quick. 2.) Bring your stomach with you because they don’t skip on portions. I was met with a small mountain of delicious chicken, vegetables, sushi, spring rolls, and fried rice. 3.) The food was very delicious and savory. 4.) The in house made yum yum sauce was excellent. 5.) The staff were friendly, professional, and attentive. 6.) For less then 30 dollars to feed 2 people I received more than what I paid for, so very affordable. Overall I feel I’ve found my new favorite lunch spot. If you happen to be in the area and looking for a bite to eat you won’t be unhappy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                    |
| Definitely won't be ordering again. The food was actually good , but to be almost done with your food, take a bite then have to pull a long string of hair out of your mouth that was in the bite of food you just took. This was my first time getting food from here. My meal was definitely ruined. I've worked back of the house before. There are reasons the staff is super to wear either a hairnet or have their hair pulled back with a hat on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [['Hygiene', 'Negative'], ['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                    |
| Love this place! The Salmon Sushirito is THE BOMB, I order it at least once a week. MUST TRY !!!

| The food is super tasty. Beef and shrimp are juicy. They come fast and smell well. Staffs are friendly. It’s a cozy place for family.

| Shockingly delicious, fast, incredibly fresh food in a brand new, smaller spot off Princess Anne & Witchduck. The salmon poke bowl was full of fresh, silky salmon and crunchy, chilled vegetables on top of warm, slightly sticky rice. Amazing and we have already been twice since they opened. HIGHLY recommend!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [['Food', 'Negative']]                                                                                                               |
| My husband, my nephew and I went there yesterday. I saw the place a few weeks ago and really was excited to try it. The food was very plain. None of us enjoyed the food.

| From a malayali persceptive, the food was horrible, this was recommended by my friend and the biriyani was ice cold and the kathi roll was even more horrible, the roadside kathi roll for me personally tastes hundres times better than this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [['Food', 'Negative']]                                                                                                               |
| Earlier today I ordered biryani from here. I found a cockroach in my biryani. This is horrible and horrendous! There is no check on hygiene at the restaurant and it's shocking. How me and my family could now be sick as we had earlier already eaten half the biryani and found the cockroach. Horrible and dissappointing! The restaurant needs to be checked if it is following protocol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [['Hygiene', 'Negative']]                                                                                                            |

| I think Lazeez is as close to Kolkata or Bengali cuisine that you can get in Bangalore. I had a chicken roll and a chicken biryani here. If I talk about the Biriyani, the Aloo was soft while the chicken and rice were well marinated and the flavours were amazing. The only thing that I could maybe improve in the Biriyani would be a little bit of less Elaichi. If I talk about the chicken roll, it had all the right flavours. The chicken was well marinated and We had some onions with a pinch of lemon and capsicum as the feeling in the role due to which the taste of the chicken was not getting over powered. If I talk about the ambience, that was nothing special, the place was decent & clean. The service was good, but the food was the main hero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Hygiene', 'Negative']]                          |
| One of the best places in Bangalore to have the classic Kolkata Awadhi style biryani and my go to place here in the city...the taste is as close as it can get to the delicious Calcutta biryani..very few tables and a small no-frills restaurant. Staff are polite and service is good. The biryani rice itself is not too oily and not too dry..very balanced..the mutton pieces were pretty good but could have been just slightly more tender, soft and juicy...the decent-size potato piece (invariably the main highlight of the biryani) too was very tasty but could have been a little more on the tender side...Do note they don't provide the egg which is a must...so make sure to ask for the boiled egg separately which we did :)..overall it remains my favourite place for Kol-style Biryani in Bangalore and Bengalis here must visit to get a decent taste of our homeland's most favourite dish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                   |

| Lazeez by Shiraz is a true taste of Calcutta. The dishes are prepared in original Calcutta style and taste amazing. The ambience and interior has a nice glimpse of Calcutta. Highly recommended for people from Calcutta or people who like the food from there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                                                                                     |
| The best kolkata style biriyani with potato (but they serve it without egg, half star deducted for that) I had in Koramangala Area is this, Lazeez. The biriyani was light, mutton pieces were soft n tender, aloo too. But my vegetarian colleague took a paneer dish with roti, and seeing that I thought edible oil prices had a catastrophic fall. (Other half star deducted for the abundance of oil in other dishes).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative']]                                                                                      |
| Lazeez, located in Koramangala 5th Block, Bangalore, is a North Indian and Mughlai restaurant that serves a range of dishes including biryani, kebabs, and rolls. If you are looking for some food, Lazeez might be a ok visit, although it might not be the best place around. They are good in dishes like the Mutton Pasinda, Kathi Rolls, Tawa Chicken, and Mutton Rogan Josh. These dishes have received rave reviews in the past for their rich flavors and excellent taste. However, some of my friends have told me that the quality of the food has gone down in recent times, which is something to keep in mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [['Food', 'Negative']]                                                                                                               |
| The mutton biryani was decent/below average. The biryani was not hot since it was late. The biryani had two pieces and a potato. The flavor was mild and subtle.

| I had ordered from Zomato, the mutton biriyani was fine however the mutton Shami kebab was rotten and smelt stale. Chicken korma’s gravy was absolutely tasteless and the chicken was hard and not cooked well and the icing on the cake was a fine strand of hair on the egg. Disgusting experience! It spoilt the appetite completely. Never ordering again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Hygiene', 'Negative']]                                                                                      |
| The place is extremely unhygienic, the cashier nor the waiters were wearing a mask. Ordered for Chicken Kassa and Garlic Naan; Naan was brilliant but the chicken Kassa was served cold and to top it the chicken has feathers left on it and that's it there was no way I was going to eat meal here. Very disappointing to see how they have no value for the foot fall they have post the lockdown while so many restaurants right round them have shut because they're unable to survive out here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [['Hygiene', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                          |
| I reach out there for Amazing tasty (Kolkata style) Biryani & Rolls. Must mention, Chicken Chaap is also quite tasty there. Price is around Rs. 250 for Mutton Biryani. Not the best comfortable place to dine, but surely One of the Tastiest Biryani places in town.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative']]                                                            |
| I had ordered lunch from Lazeez, Koramangala today for lunch. One of the gravy dishes I had paid Rs350/- when I received the order the quantity was not even half the container and it had only oil in it. How can one eat only oil when contacted Swiggy and restaurant both the people refused to help me saying that’s a semi gravy and did not even listen to help. I am totally disappointed and would never recommend anyone to plz order food from Lazeez. The restaurant manager was so rude and not even willing to listen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                             |
| Even before knowing what a Kolkata style Biriyani is, I have been a big fan of the Biriyani from Lucky Restaurant in Mumbai. That joy of discovering the big fat potato buried deep inside the Biriyani is not only fun, but a reminder of how cultures across India are very similar. I am from the south & we dare put a potato in our Biriyani. However, my mom would never make a Mutton curry without adding a few potatoes, & I believe that’s how an authentic Kolkata style Mutton curry is made as well. Between my trips to Mumbai (which are not very often) I get the best Kolkata style Biriyani right at home when upon request wifey found the recipe of Lucky on an old edition of times, online. But whenever I speak proudly of this to my Bengali friends, I am always given references of great Biriyani’s served in Kolkata & in a few places in Bangalore. Lazeez is one such place that tops the list of recommendations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [['Food', 'Negative']]                                                                                                               |
| For Lazeez Calcutta style cuisines, I've visited this place a few times now and their food never goes wrong. I always take a roll, bread is crispy from outside & soft within and fillings are delicious. I've also tried a few other dishes and all of them are good. I went on weekends and I never had to wait for a table here. I guess the reason is their simple ambiance and focused menu (do not serve a large variety of cuisines). Their prices are also very affordable which makes it a delight. If you want to enjoy some flavorsome savory meals, this is one of the places.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                                                            |
| Ordered chicken and mutton biryani from this place, and to be frank the biryani was not at all good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [['Food', 'Negative']]                                                                                                               |
| Ordered the following- Mughlai Chicken Biryani, Mutton Biryani, Chicken Tikka Kabab, Phirni. Mughlai Chicken Biryani is worth the money, both quantity and taste-wise. Mutton Biryani tastes decent too. The Chicken Tikka Kabab was a tad bit disappointing, lacking taste and a bit overcooked. The phirni was not as it should be, much thicker like jelly and tasted a bit more sweet. Overall, good experience. Good for a heavy lunch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [['Food', 'Negative']]                                                                                                               |
| Excellent Kolkata Biryani. Authentic food. The naan was just like what we get in Kolkata. The Chicken Chap was too good. The Chicken and Mutton Biryani were beautifully aromatic and the rice was so good. We had packed Chicken Rolls too. They were extremely delicious. Very tasty.

| I wish we could rate this restaurant without a star. Ordered biryani and extra aloo. What we didn’t know was that it would be accompanied with a fly / cockroach. All Zomato said was 'we are sorry' and gave us a refund. Standard response of 'we will notify the restaurant.' What is surprising is that how this restaurant can be so callous about their preparation of food and quality control.

| I was searching for authentic Kolkata Biriyani and landed up getting a name 'Lazeez' for being so famous for Kolkata style biriyani destination. Soon after ordered through Swiggy and I got in 50mins time. I was eagerly waiting, so I opened and it looked good, I ate almost half of it, But I was shocked to see the cockroach in the middle of the plate and I did vomit after that. Guys I will never order from this place, that's for sure. No wonders, what they cook and how they cook!! Just be aware of this place and avoid.

| I used to crave for Lazeez food. Weekends was mostly Lazeez food. It's a good place for Kolkata biryani and Mughlai food, prices are reasonable but a bit on a higher side. In the last 3 years, the quality of taste has gone down a lot. Recently I did go again as my spouse liked Lazeez food a lot. This time she also accepted the fact that the quality has gone down considerably. We asked for 2 plates of shami kabab, the dish was not served till the end we finished. We had to ask why it was not served, and we were told that it happened due to computer system mistake sometimes. When told that we have already finished our food and cancel the dish now, the staff said that it cannot be canceled as the system has already updated. Not sure what was the confusion, but found it very rude conversing with the person serving there and at the billing counter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative']]                                                    |
| This is a very very dirty place, I have personally experienced twice, once a cockroach in Chicken Biryani and Lizard leg in Chicken Bharta, this is a Disgusting dirty place..will never purchase anything from this Lazeez Restaurant.

| Food is always good and tasty. Seating arrangement is shrinking day by day, though. Update @ 2025: The interior is redecorated. It's a nice new look, but the hand wash area and the bathroom (they are at separate locations) are very tiny.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative'], ['Hygiene', 'Negative']]                                                            |
| Excellent food and good service. Ambience is not very good.

| Taste of their dishes is quite good (especially Chicken Rolls or any other Tandoori item) which keeps 1 star. BUT the service got really worse over time and yesterday’s experience keeps me from visiting again: It started with a rude placement to a table without any greeting. When asking for a glass which was also given to other people, they demonstrated their care for cleanliness. I was given a dirty glass having an insect inside. I informed the staff immediately and expected an excuse as well as a replacement of the glass. Neither happened - they just took the dirty glass and disappeared...unbelievable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [['Hygiene', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Food', 'Negative']]                                                    |
| Worst biriyani.. They are fooling in the name of Kolkata biriyani.. Mutton was not fresh and not cooked.. Rice was full of kewda water which made the taste of the rice bitter. Complete waste of money.. Never ever order from here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [['Food', 'Negative']]                                                                                                               |

| Visited this outlet after a gap of 7-8 years. I used to visit their old Commercial road branch very often and this restaurant used to be the only source of Kolkata Mughlai food in Bangalore. Coming to food, we ordered mutton tikiya roll, mutton tikiya, chicken chaap, mutton biryani and paratha. Tikiya roll, chaap and tikiya were below average in taste. In fact, the gravy was red (food color used) in color. Only positive was paratha and biryani. Was disappointed with the deteriorated quality. May not visit again as I stay in Whitefield. Lost cause.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [['Food', 'Negative']]                                                                                                               |
| Food taste was very bad. Service I will say it was negative! The behavior of the waiter was so bad. He was about to fight with us. I would recommend to immediately remove these kind of staff from your outlet. They simply don’t know how to behave with a customer. He was on his own attitude and was arguing with us regarding bill and order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                             |
| The food is very so so. Meat plate — all meat a bit over done and very stiff…. Bread aside is dry and stiff 😅😅  Drinks tastes is not like cocktail 😮‍💨 Pasta — should serve more warm.

| Great to visit Prague and The Prince Outdoor Seating area is right in the middle of the fun. Near the square, across from the Astronomical Clock, and near shops and hotels. We stopped and got an outdoor table quickly and easily. Host was super friendly and helped us get a good table. Outdoor seating had heaters and blankets to help those cold days and nights too. Outdoor seating was fun and lots of energy everywhere.  Highlight of the service was our server Kleyner! Started out joking with us right away which really started our day off right! Shared a few quick things about each other and loved his story and supporting his family in Cuba. He was always around and ready to support us. Gave great recommendations too. We started with the Lobster Soup and the Goulash! Both were hot and delicious. For Entrees we both ordered the Wiener Schnitzel and loved it. Highly recommend it too. Enjoyed a Large Mug of beer and a nice glass of wine. Can't wait to visit again as it was a great time with great food.  Checked out quickly and Kleyner made sure everything was good. Thanks man and best wishes for you and your son.

| I was a bit skeptical as it's in the square but I had such a good experience. Denisa was lovely! Quick to come over, knew exactly what I wanted (I ordered the lobster soup and she asked if I'd like garlic bread with it 😊). The food came quickly and I really enjoyed it, as well as the merlot which was a good size. Price was reasonable for what we had. Good sizes and we really enjoyed!

| Cool location but biggest tourist trap ever.  We walked in with the intention of escaping the cold, only to be seated right next to the door in the wind. We asked for another table, which turned out to be even colder. We ate the burgers and pasta. The burger was cold and dry, and there was a handful of fries, without any ketchup/sauce, which made them incredibly dry. In comparison, the Carbonara was warm and delicious. There were 50 waiters strolling around the place, vaping, and looking useless. At the register, the waiter - which didn't even serve us - tipped himself ~10€ without asking. There was one cool and chill guy at the entrance who didn't speak one word of English. 🤷‍♀️ For this price, you could buy two whole menus at McDonald's- which taste way better Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person Kč 600–700 Food: 2 Service: 2 Atmosphere: 3 Parking space Difficult to find parking Parking options Parking is unavailable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                          |
| Our party of 4 was ready for dinner at 7pm. The menu outside tented area looks good and people under the tent appeared comfortable in this cold evening. I had the pasta and risotto. The friendly server was Denisa. We were very satisfied with the food and quick service.

| Overrated, food less than decent, everything is dry. The only good thing is kind waitress. We gave tip but turn out they already put tip 12.5% automatically that we didn’t know at first, we put more in the end because of that.

| Overall score 2. First of all, not cheap, because it’s already located in the center, I can understand that. I ordered a rib eye steak and my wife ordered a Wagyu Burger. Both were quite poor. Wagyu was overcooked, admitting she wanted a well-done, but this was dry as hell. My ribeye on the other hand had lots of gristle, which I hate most. Beer tasted (Staroprammen on tap) like iron, no sauce with the French fries, I can extend the list to morning. This is December 30th so city is overcrowded but I’m paying a high premium to get a better and quicker service and product, but in all ways this restaurant failed tonight.

| Unbelievably bad service all around. I cut my lip on a beer mug that was badly chipped, they brought another but charged for both. My husband requested his meal in a take-away box as did my mom, but only my mom’s food was present in the bag when we arrived home. The waiter argued about how the menu had presented the lobster as being with sauce…very unprofessional. The atmosphere and location are superb, the waiters are horrid. They also kicked us out and said “we’re closed” about 1 minute after their official close time. Essentially begged for a tip as well, and then included it in the bill despite it reading as “tip not included”. Recommend, if you don’t mind endangering yourself on cut glasses or beer mugs. And terrible service. Waiter was smug and rude about how long the food prep took as well. Since it was vacation I’d go here again and do it over, but be warned if you like good service, this is not a place for you. Pricey, but to be expected for the locale. $150 for 3. No expensive drinks ordered either.

| Very good cocktails. Goat cheese Salad with Beetroot was delicious. Crispy and fresh French fries. I would skip the club sandwich next time. Alec, our server was lovely and has a cute personality.

| I wanted to take my son to a special place to eat on our last day in Prague and the roof-terrace was recommended. The food was average and relatively bland, small quantity and a bit pricey. Here you are paying for the location and view and unfortunately not for the food taste. The staff was rushed and not friendly. The Head Waiter pushed for a 12%+ Tip on the bill when you pay with credit card. Even if it was a nice view, it was extremely loud and you felt like a rushed tourist instead of a guest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                    |

| Very nice atmosphere, good drinks and food. And really very good service: the waiter Fanda gave us very good suggestions about what we would like to have for food (the choice is really huge) and was always there for us even though the restaurant was pretty full.

Overall the restaurant was really good and especially the service here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                             |
| Very local traditional food. We got recommended from our tour guide, and it was just great. Ordered some local kind of steak with sauce and some salad. The restaurant maybe very busy, as it is small, so consider when you want to come. Price is value for money, atmosphere just great, we loved it, go there and enjoy it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative']]                                                            |

| It is an amazing place with the cozy atmosphere, on the terrace are heating machines and waiters (especially Kleyner) are always there to catch your order, drinks are good, the choice is very wide - definitely recommend it for the evening visit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [['Ambiance', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                         |

| We ordered two dishes for the meal and beer. The price turned out to be relatively high compared to all the other places we ate at. Small and disrespectful portions! They even charged me the price of half a beer on a ketchup! Really audacious and annoying. It's like they're trying to rob me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [['Pricing', 'Negative'], ['Food', 'Negative']]                                                                                      |

| We enjoyed a fabulous lunch here served by Fanda. We enjoyed the Beef Ghoulash soup and a club sandwich. The service from Fanda was excellent, checking we were ok and had everything we needed. Great value.

| We walked by this restaurant and sat outside. We didn’t have food, but had a few drinks. The menu was well described and Denisa our waitress was lovely. Spoke very good English and was very prompt.

| Daniel was the best. We came to have a couple of drinks and relax. He made perfect recommendations for a plate to snack with our beverage. Honestly, he was so wonderful we came back in the evening for dessert just to dine with him again!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Food', 'Negative']]                                                                             |
| The place and location are really nice, and the service is very lovely and professional. However, quite tasteless food, maybe because of my poor selection 😝 or that the place is mainly focusing on drinks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Food', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                                                   |
| Fantastic experience! Our waitress Melanie was very helpful and attentive.

| Pros: Great location; Cons: First of all, it's very pricey compared to other places, but kind of expected based on location. Ordered a beer and cappuccino (received grand cappuccino even though we did not ask for one). Waiters are being pushed by the manager to go from table to table every 10-15 minutes to push people to order more, or to leave, which is passively implied. After less than 30 minutes and second visit from the waiter, we asked for a bill, and the bill was 275 crowns instead of 184. They charged a grand cappuccino even though we ordered a regular, and a waiter's commission for the tip of 12.5%. Service was bad, pushy, aggressive to order or to leave, do not recommend, there are many nice places in Prague to enjoy great food and beer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [['Pricing', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Food', 'Negative']]                                                    |
| Came for drinks. There wasn’t a lot of people but we waited a bit for them to sit us. A few staff members walked right in front of us without saying a word to us (felt invisible) and when someone finally came to sit us, she just said 'sit there' no hello, no anything. Our waiter was so rude, just came over and said 'what do you want' again not even a hello. We ordered one Bellini and one Mojito (he didn’t ask what size of mojito and obviously gave us the XL which is more expensive). But the drinks were okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative']]                                                                          |
| Our server, Kleyner, was very attentive. We had our Great Dane with us. While it threw the kitchen off a little that we ordered a grilled chicken breast for our dog, they accommodated us. My husband had the chicken caesar salad, and I had the hearty chicken soup. Both were excellent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                             |

| A must-have been in Prague. The goulash and the pork knuckle were extremely good and try the dark beer really good. Price is OK comparing to other places and I love it a little bit old style like we were there twice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative']]                                                                                      |

| The u prince was a great experience. Kleyner was very helpful as were all staff.

| Paulina was an amazing server. Her recommendation on dishes was on point! She was very attentive and checked to make sure we had everything we needed.

| Server was fine, the rest of the staff seemed annoyed they had a job. But the drinks were pathetic overall. Worst dark and stormy I've had in my entire life. The view is nice but they can't regulate the temperature at all, either way too hot or cold.

| Daniel was exceptional, the very definition of professional and hospitable. We would absolutely dine here again, in fact, we came back later for dessert and found him still working. Please promote this man, he is a treasured asset to this company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                                                   |
| I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who visits Prague. It's right in the city center and you can see the famous clock singing every hour. Both inside and outside are comfortable and nice to stay. The staff are so far the best. They serve local cuisine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                                                                         |
| I understand serving the crowds of tourists must be super stressful, but still, the guy taking orders wasn't nice at all. Could understand that though, if the food was good, but that didn't happen either - the hot dog was cold and the taste didn't match the price at all. Plus a long waiting time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Food', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative']]                                                    |
| We were on vacation in Prague and the restaurant caught our eye with their selection. As soon as we went in, we were met by Wendy who works there and she was fantastic. Really cheerful. Answered any questions we had about the menu including dessert.

| Slightly more expensive than most nice Prague restaurants. The service was excellent, the food was fairly basic. Steak was average. Denisa was an excellent waitress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [['Pricing', 'Negative'], ['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                    |
| On our visit to Prague, after wandering around and seeing the sights, my wife and I also wanted to eat in a restaurant that offers typical Czech dishes. Goulash and beer seemed like the right choice for us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [['Food', 'Negative']]                                                                                                               |

| Our waiter Kleyner was very nice and it was also very nice that you can sit outside in cold temperatures without freezing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                                                                         |

| A lovely gem for food. Cash only. Beer and cocktails were really cheap and the food was excellent. We had the buffalo chicken tenders for starter which were really big, juicy and slightly spicy - a must try. Then we had various burgers for mains, the choker burgers are huge. The fries were really good, and the spicy mayo a nice addition. Staff were great, and very attentive and on top of bringing us what we wanted. Absolutely amazing! Will hopefully be back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                    |

And the chicken wings? Let me tell you—they are literally to die for. Perfectly seasoned, tender, and just the right amount of spicy kick. To top off the experience, we ended our meal with a shot of local Czech whiskey. Enjoy! I will return!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                                                   |
| Excellent bar! Beer is cheap and excellent. The only flaw is they only serve 0.5l, I prefer 0.3l. Burgers are amazing! If you stop by you should definitely try them. Tasty, juicy, perfect! The fries amazed me as well. Had to return to order just the fries again. Huge recommendation!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative']]                                                                                      |
| Absolutely incredible bar. If you have to wait for a table it's 100% worth it. The burgers and sandwiches are to die for. We had the chicken and cheese sandwich and the jalapeño burger. Both with fries, both delicious. We also had the buffalo tenders to start. Service was very very good, friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is also very good, great music, quirky pictures and murals. Love it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                                                   |

| I recently visited this bar and was thoroughly impressed. The place looks fantastic, with a unique style that really sets it apart. As for the food, it was exceptional. I had the Bacon Burger, which I can highly recommend. The burger was cooked to perfection, with a great balance of flavors. I also tried the Buffalo Wings as a starter, and they were amazing, especially with the sauce that complemented them perfectly. The service was equally impressive. The staff were incredibly attentive, friendly, and offered great recommendations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                                                   |

If you come after 6pm it's better to make a reservation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                             |
| The atmosphere is fantastic. The staff are friendly and welcoming, making the experience even more enjoyable. I ordered a salad, which was fresh and delicious, but I could tell from the vibe and the menu that their burgers are the real deal:)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                                                   |
| Super original and delicious burgers here. Portion sizes are huge (especially the double patty ones, not for the weak!) and amazing value for money. Really great veggie options too with a whole selection of portobello mushroom-based burgers instead of meat. The staff were friendly and food came in good time. It felt like a nice place for locals, in an area much quieter than the main old town, so definitely a gem to go to for a great burger away from the tourist central hub.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                                                   |
| Having finally digested this enormous burger I can say it was good, although the meat was not thoroughly grilled as I like it but was medium well. I guess that's what people want these days. And although in the menu is described as having a lot of onion, in actuality it was just normal. The burger could be eaten neatly, almost nothing fell off. The taste was also normal, nothing special. A cocktail that was ordered was on the smaller side, but arguably quite professional. I would have preferred a larger size that could be enjoyed as a refreshment. Again popular demand at play here I think. Overall great quality place, and I should also note the excellent service of the staff that were very capable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                             |
| I’ve been to Sad Man’s Tongue Bar every time I’m in Prague, and it never disappoints. The Burger Onion Smash is absolutely perfect—juicy, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The waitstaff are incredibly polite, speak English fluently, and provide excellent service. It’s refreshing to find a place that isn’t a tourist trap but still offers top-notch food and atmosphere. Just a heads-up—make sure to bring cash with you. Overall, it’s always a great experience, and I highly recommend it!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                                                   |
| We visited here based on a Google search and it was totally worth it. That was the best beef burger we've ever had!! Great sauce to dip your chips in, fresh produce and non-greasy. Great friendly service and value for money. Totally recommend!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative']]                                                    |
| Amazing burgers!!! I was full for hours afterwards. 🤤🍔🍟🍺🍻🍺 We had the Praguer burger which is topped with pickled vegetables (gherkins and chillis) with mustard and cheese and the Oklahoma burger which has two patties onions and cheese. Burgers come with fries and a super nice chilli mayo type dipping sauce. The burger came medium/medium rare (pink) too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [['Food', 'Negative']]                                                                                                               |
| Wasn’t sure if this place would be worth the hype but it definitely was. You might have to wait to get in but the service is really friendly and the food is great. The nachos are a big portion for two people and the burgers were some of the best I’ve ever had. Well worth a visit!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                             |
| I’ve eaten many many burgers and hands down this is the best burger I have ever laid my gracious hands on. The beef was cooked to perfection and was complemented with perfection on top of a soft bun. The fries were delicious served alongside a sweet chilli mayo sauce causing a party in your mouth. The service is unmatched—you feel so welcome, and the drinks are so tasty. The whole vibe is inviting, cozy, and happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                                                   |
| We both got burgers which were so delicious accompanied by fries. They were big. The lady serving us was really nice, letting us know that nachos were also a huge portion so maybe we couldn’t finish everything (she was right). Potatoes were also very delicious. It was a small place but cozy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                                                   |

| We had a bit of a wait outside and in the waiting area, but we could order drinks, which was a nice touch. The restaurant had a great old-school diner vibe, but keep in mind it’s cash-only. We tried the buffalo chicken tenders and the Chica Chica Boom burger—both delicious. Our server, Paulina, was fantastic; she brought us a full platter of hot sauces and shared excellent food and bar recommendations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                                                   |

| Showed up here right as it opened. The manager quickly found us a table and got us set up with drinks and food. Beer selection is typical of Prague but the mixed drinks were quite good. Within 10 minutes of opening, there were already six other customers. Ended up coming back later in the evening and the place was totally packed. Service was very good, and the waiters were quite friendly and spoke excellent English.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                             |
| My husband and I recently spent a few days in Prague and were on the hunt for a place with great burgers. Since I’m vegetarian and my husband isn’t, we wanted somewhere that could cater to both our preferences. We found this gem of a restaurant online and decided to give it a try. We were blown away by the incredible burgers! I had the portobello burger, which was simply amazing. The fries were also fantastic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                             |

| Amazing experience. Felt like the 50s were real, delicious "American" food, immersive atmosphere with a lot of posters, and last but not least excellent music. The service was so warm and welcoming. I recommend it without a doubt in my mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                                                   |

| Everything was awesome. I had the chicken option, my boyfriend had the beef option, and they were the best burgers we had in our entire lives. It gives me goosebumps to remember those flavors. They served a cherry liqueur at the end to help us digest—it was also perfect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                             |

| Absolutely one of the best burger & beer experiences in my life! That speaks volumes as I owned a Canadian burger joint in Asia for many years. Very cool atmosphere and good service. Likely a pure mistake, but was shortchanged K1000 on my change. Spoke up quickly and it was rectified immediately (with an apology & shot!). Will be back!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                                                   |

| This place is every bit as good as the other reviews suggest. The service, decor, atmosphere, and food are all excellent. As a vegetarian, I really appreciated that I could choose any burger on the menu with a veggie patty. The onion rings are to die for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                                                   |

| This was just half a block from my hotel, so I decided to check it out.  The breakfast was amazing and affordable, and I was impressed with how efficient the staff was.  The place was packed, and yet it wasn't a long wait at all for the table, the food, or the check.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [['Food', 'Positive'], ['Pricing', 'Positive'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                    |
| Do not order the hot cakes. Service is slow and it was not that busy. Our waiter was good, but another that was serving coffee refills next to our table, totally ignored us. He turned around to look at me when I asked him for coffee and just left, his coffee pots were pretty full. Another waiter passing by told him that I was signaling him, he ignored him too. Clearly ignored me, like, 'that's not my table.' I brought it up to the cashier. Never going back there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                                                   |

| Overrated coffee shop. The food is nothing extraordinary and expensive. I recommend ordering whatever you want except tlalpeño broth, it is a simple rice broth with beaten chicken and costs 200 pesos...really a chicken consommé with rice for 200?

Very old, dirty bathrooms, ugly food of poor quality and very expensive for 3 tasteless breads, some disque Swiss enchiladas and 2 watered down coffees with Liconsa milk we paid 385 it was a robbery in an unpopulated area the truth is there are better places with better seasoning and quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative'], ['Hygiene', 'Negative']]                                                             |
| This is a gem in the city. Although it only accepts cash, its location is quite convenient when you finish your party and you crave for an after meal.

| Overrated coffee shop. The food is nothing extraordinary and expensive. I recommend ordering whatever you want except tlalpeño broth, it is a simple rice broth with beaten chicken and costs 200 pesos...really a chicken consommé with rice for 200? Not even a single meal anymore                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [['Pricing', 'Negative'], ['Food', 'Negative']]                                                                                      |
| Horrible place. Very old, dirty bathrooms, ugly food of poor quality and very expensive for 3 tasteless breads, some disque Swiss enchiladas and 2 watered down coffees with Liconsa milk we paid 385 it was a robbery in an unpopulated area the truth is there are better places with better seasoning and quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative'], ['Hygiene', 'Negative']]                                                             |
| The pastas were absolutely delicious and probably the best I've had in Seoul, the pizza however was mediocre at best, very thin and very soggy I was disappointed greatly. I would rate this place 2 stars if it was just the pizza..but the pasta was so delicious I had to raise it. I will definitely come again here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [['Food', 'Positive']]                                                                                                               |
| The Good: - Authentic Italian menu options The Not So Good: - The pizza was made too thin considering the amount of the tomato sauce and it was too soggy - The spinach in the ravioli had a bitter aftertaste - Waiters weren’t the most attentive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                             |
| Been here a few times and always a treat. Lasagna is absolute 🔥 and the calzone was different than normal but closer to a folded pizza and delicious. The arancini balls are really good but probably wouldn't order again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [['Food', 'Positive']]                                                                                                               |

We have been several times and tried many of their dishes which are amazing every time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [['Food', 'Positive']]                                                                                                               |
| The food is absolutely delicious. We had the eggplant pasta and the Buffala Margherita pizza, both of them were equally delicious and yummy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [['Food', 'Positive']]                                                                                                               |
| This Italian restaurant is a really nice place to enjoy Italian cuisine. Specifically, lasagna and tiramisu are super. Wines are a little bit pricey but dishes are not expensive but really delicious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [['Food', 'Positive'], ['Pricing', 'Negative']]                                                                                      |

| It is in a good location on the Yurakucho side of Ginza Corridor Street. The basement of an elegant commercial building. Both food and wine are delicious, but the amount is small for the unit price, so it will be expensive for a large number of people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [['Food', 'Positive'], ['Pricing', 'Negative']]                                                                                      |

| I used it for my anniversary and reserved a message plate, but perhaps because it was busy, the customer service was sloppy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                                                   |
| The dining experience was consistently poor, with several issues that significantly impacted the quality of the food. The service was subpar, and we received only one of the three Nun dishes we ordered after finishing our main course. The remaining dishes were also of poor quality, lacking flavor and being excessively priced. This was the most disappointing dining experience I have ever had.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative']]                                                    |
| I am very disappointed with their food. May be my previous experience with them was good that's why.. or may be they changed chef... Ordered mutton kofta biriyani... Rice was flavourful, but kofta was horrible.. it was hard and too much chewy...laccha porota was very hard, curry of mutton kosha was good but they gave 3 pieces of bones which was disappointing, if I am paying 1100+ for this dish...lacchi and mint lemonade were the only good things there. Shahi tukra wasn't like shahi tukra you usually eat..it was like sweet from sweet shop..but it looked like shahi tukra though....overall..atmosphere is great, service was good....but food was a big let down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Positive'], ['Ambiance', 'Positive']]                                                   |

| A great place for Indian food lovers. Indian cuisine is my favourite. And this place satisfied me very much. Loved their alu paratha, chicken tanduri kabab and dal makhni. Beef pasinda kabab is good too if you like spicy food. Kulfi was not that great. Good place for family and group hangouts. Quite spacious and enjoyable for a long duration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [['Food', 'Positive'], ['Ambiance', 'Positive']]                                                                                     |

| Lucknow Dhaka, a well-known restaurant in Banani. It is located at Banani 18 road: House 35, Block B, Dhaka-1213. Food quality is great. Service is also good. The environment is fine as well. The restaurant has few parking facilities inside its place. But price of the foods seem higher.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [['Food', 'Positive'], ['Customer Service', 'Positive'], ['Pricing', 'Negative']]                                                    |
| The food quality is average. But hospitality is the worst in Dhaka. Importantly, if you want to host a dinner for foreigners, do not ever pick this place. They don’t serve food, they’ll throw food. One of the waiters came and served the food keeping his one hand in his pocket and other holding food.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                             |

| It's an absolute shame how this place has deteriorated. The food used to be good. But every item was terribly seasoned and insipid. Wait staff can't provide recommendations, instead rushing through the menu seems irritated why we are taking our time to order. Came here for Dads birthday but never again. Please don't waste your time and money coming here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                             |
| The taste of the food is authentic. However, it's way more expensive. There are a lot of restaurants available with similar tastes even better at a very reasonable price. Ambience and Services are good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [['Food', 'Positive'], ['Ambiance', 'Positive'], ['Pricing', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                          |

| This is daylight robbery at its best. Nothing but an elaborate scam. They have dishes (we ordered Chicken Tikka Butter Masala and Mutton Handi Biriyani) that they claim is for four people priced at a whopping 1050 BDT, but it's barely enough for even one person. The price to food ratio is just ridiculous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [['Pricing', 'Negative'], ['Food', 'Negative']]                                                                                      |

| Exceptional Indian food. The taste was really good although the price is a bit too much. No compromise on the quality though.

| The food was okayish. Nothing out of the ordinary. The internal decor was ambient. Most terrible part had been their service. The food price is unimaginably high and their staffs mislead you with subtle information gaps. And please never try their Parda Biriyani. That item is just non-palatable with a ridiculously high price tag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Positive'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative']]                          |

| The chicken handi biryani was one of the worst biryani I have ever had in my life so far, it was flavorless and bland with the chicken being extremely hard with no tenderness at all however the mutton roganjosh was good with nice flavors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [['Food', 'Negative']]                                                                                                               |

| We went just an hour before the kitchen closed so everything was rushed. Also, made us sit near the entrance which was annoying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [['Customer Service', 'Negative'], ['Ambiance', 'Negative']]                                                                         |
| There was a cockroach on our table last night. I captured it under a glass and then the waiter came and killed it as if it were a regular Friday night activity for him. We canceled our order and left right away. Unacceptable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [['Hygiene', 'Negative'], ['Customer Service', 'Negative']]                                                                          |

| Test of food is good. But why is it so expensive?

| Loud guests. There was a time we would go to restaurants to enjoy a quiet meal with friends. But not anymore.

| The place is cozy and incredibly beautiful. But the service stood out even more than the good menu. I couldn’t be better welcomed as I was by Mark. It made everything look even better.

| The beef burger was the worst, it made me almost vomit, the meat was not chewable. Also tried formaggio pizza, it was like 6 out of 10 for an Italian restaurant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [['Food', 'Negative']]                                                                                                               |
| Drinks were good, and the entree had great flavor, but the salmon pasta main was bland and overpriced. The total bill wasn’t justified against the many restaurant offerings in City Walk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative']]                                                                                      |
| Excellent service & food. We had our corporate dinner organized at Primi City Walk. Gladys was the host alongside Marc.

When ordered, it came with no truffle on top, tasted no truffle, smelled no truffle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [['Food', 'Negative'], ['Pricing', 'Negative']]                                                                                      |
| Better don't order fish filet as you pay for the weight of the entire fish even if you're getting filet only.
